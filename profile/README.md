# Welcome

This is the repository for the Lakes Community High School Robotics Club, Iron Eagles.

To anyone who is currently a member of the club and needs help with the codebase, please contact Cody Summerson.

Mr. Strzyinski should also have full ownership access, and ownership should be passed along cheif coders as necessary.

In general, I recommend creating a fresh repository for each year of the club, named 20XX-First-Last to keep naming consistent. New repositories need to be forked from the main FTC branch and cloned to a computer, whereby you can open it in Android Studio and proceed from there. General practice suggests keeping code for old robot designs in their respective repositories, that way a team can keep proper track of their progress over a year.

To name your TeleOp files, I suggest adding something like the acronym of the competition, so CS for Center Stage at the time of writing, followed by the robot type, and finally iteration of the code if you have multiple files for the same bot. For example, "CS-PushBot-2". This should give you easy and unique identifers for your drivers and for future reference. 
Autonomous scripts should be named similarly, just make sure to include your position and alliance color if necessary. For example, "CS-PushBot-Left-Red-2". 
Feel free to remove hyphens when providing a string for the driver to select in the driver station.

At the time of writing this page, I am currently working on training new apprentices to both code using Android Studio and use git as version control. If you lose access to someone who knows how to manage those codebases, please ask Mr. Strzyinski for a way to contact me and I will do my best to help you.

You may always use FIRST's documentation, and decide to retun to OnBotJava if you determine it is better for your skill level. However, I suggest git and Android Studio, as it gives you proper experience with programs used in professional careers. Ultimately, do what works best for you.

While I'll be hypocritcal and won't do it to myself, I suggest removing writing permissions from alumni, simply for security reasons if their account is compromised.
